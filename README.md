# HuttValleyIssueReport
Android Application which lets people report issues within their community and vote for issues which have already been posted 
to help quantify the effect of issues

This app was made as an NZQA Technology Scholarship Project in 2017.

As a result, I was awarded the Hutt Valley Youth Award for Science and Technology

The documentation for how the app was made is [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AWbNEMxqs5Etsjn7G1_YKnQYHY_XL3Pb)
